# Important:
- Intention: Test alpha releases to prevent testing with incompatible versions on IOHK network.
- Remember: To avoid spamming logs of nodes in IOHK network with regards to invalid block0 messages, please ensure to not re-use IP-port combination between different networks
- Also Remember: Before starting node, ensure your storage folder is empty
- Cap: Pools intending to run their stake pool have been distributed 3029900000000 Test ADAs, would be great if we use it as a cap.
