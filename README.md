# Important:
- Intention: Test pre-releases in a controlled environment to prevent connecting with incompatible versions on IOHK network and also have a stable environment to learn/study.
- Remember: To avoid spamming logs of nodes of other network (invalid block0), please ensure to not re-use IP-port combination between different networks
- Also Remember: Before starting node, ensure your storage folder is empty
- Cap: Pools intending to run their stake pool have been distributed 1000000000 Test Lovelaces (RC4), would be great if we use it as a cap.
